# Notes

Note that this visualisation intentionally omits any details on the internals of "Storage" and "Supplier" components, because they (although being a big part of the actual codebase) are non-importan to the central flow, which is the main idea behind the "Tangata Manu" and its universality.

Different storages might implement operations differently, for example, the existing default "Postgres Wallet" implementation manages the UTxO state and has to handle its integrity during a rollback, but upcoming alternative Elasticsearch storage only collects historical blocks and transactions in "append only" manner, but also adds its own unique kinds of aggregations, not suitable for Postgres.

In the same way different chain data suppliers can utilize their own unique quirks, specific only to their underlying components. For example, current default "Rust Bridge" supplier is based on [cardano-http-bridge](https://github.com/Emurgo/cardano-http-bridge) node, which uniquely supports downloading full historical epochs as a single file, and the supplier uses this feature to make historical syncing easier and faster. But alternative suppliers in the future (e.g. Cardano-SL supplier, or Jormungandr, etc) might not support this particular feature and therefore will implement functionality differently.

Parsers are represented as being a separate component, rather than a part of the supplier, because they might be reusable in some cases. E.g. if two different node implementations support exporting data in the native Cardno binary format (raw data) - the same parses can be used on top of it, so only, basically, the network layer will be different in this case.

We at Emurgo plan to try and support at least all official node implementattions as alternative suppliers eventually, and at the moment we are actively working on not only creating multiple alternative storage implementations (alternative on both the underlying storage used, but also in the schema and the kind of stored data), but also on making **the process** of adding an alterantive storage as easy and painless as possible, so hopefully at any point anyone could PR a new implementation and make the codebase even more diverse and universally useful.
